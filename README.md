High performance, open source software developer workspaces in the cloud.

### Cloud IDE
Use your browser to program on any machine in any language. Edit, build, debug and deploy projects bound to source repositories.  [Use Che as an IDE] (https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/import-a-project)

### Workspace Server
Create developer workspaces with APIs. Add your project types, embed custom commands and host on any infrastructure. [Use Che as a Workspace Server] (https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/create-workspaces-and-projects)

### Plug-Ins
Use Che's built-in language plug-ins or write packaged extensions that transform Che's IDE into new tools and assemblies. [Write Che IDE Plug-Ins] (https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/extension-development-workflow)
