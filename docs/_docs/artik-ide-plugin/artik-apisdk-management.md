Artik IDE provides a mechanism to manage (install, upgrade and downgrade) Artik SDK and dependency libs both in a developer workspace and on the device at `Artik > Manage SDK/APIs...`.

Artik plugin will check currently installed SDK versions on the device(s) and in a developer workspace. Available versions are fetched from Artik yum repository.
