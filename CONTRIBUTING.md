Filing Issues for Eclipse Che
=====================

Before Submitting an Issue
--------------------------
Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. You can leave a Thubms Up reaction to the original issue description to indicate that you have the same problem. Please Do not leave a "+1" or "I have this too" comment unless you are also adding material new information, as they
clutter the discussion.

Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
---------------------------------------------
Please file a single issue per problem or feature request. Do not file issues that combine problems and feature requests. Please include all the environmental information and reproduction steps so that an engineer can reproduce it.

The community wants to help you find a solution to your problem, but every problem is unique. In order for an engineer to help resolve your issue, they need to be able to reproduce it. Reproducing your specific error may require significant information about your system and environment. Help us in advance by providing a complete assessment of your system and the steps necessary to reproduce the issue.

Therefore:
* The details of your environment including OS version, container configuration, and the steps how you configure & run Che.
* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* When providing reproduction steps, start with launching Che providing its configuration and every step taken to create the problem.
* A detailed description of the behavior that you expect.
* Animated GIFs are very helpful to show the problems for engineers.
* If there are UI issues or errors, please run the steps with the browser dev console open and send those logs with your report.
