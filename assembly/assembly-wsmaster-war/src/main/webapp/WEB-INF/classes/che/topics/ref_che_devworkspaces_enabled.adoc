[id="che_devworkspaces_enabled_{context}"]
= `+CHE_DEVWORKSPACES_ENABLED+`

Specifies whether {prod-short} is deployed with DevWorkspaces enabled. This property is set by the {prod-short} Operator if it also installed the support for DevWorkspaces. This property is used to advertise this fact to the {prod-short} dashboard. It does not make sense to change the value of this property manually.
