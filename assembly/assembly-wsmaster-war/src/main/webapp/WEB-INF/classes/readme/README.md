Welcome to Eclipse Che. 

This Che workspace includes project code (on the left) and [runtimes](https://eclipse.org/che/docs/workspace/machines/index.html) (at the bottom) and can be moved from machine-to-machine or user-to-user. Workspaces use containers and web services to bring repeatability, consistency, and performance to the developer environment.

You have a root-access terminal at the bottom and all project files are synced between the browser IDE and the workspace container. Alternatively you can [SSH](https://eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/ssh/index.html) into the container or even [mount and sync](https://eclipse.org/che/docs/ide/sync/index.html) with your local filesystem.

You can read more about Che on our [site](https://eclipse.org/che/) and in our [docs](https://eclipse.org/che/docs/). 

Che is an open source project under the Eclipse Foundation that's named after Cherkasy Ukraine, the city where development started.
